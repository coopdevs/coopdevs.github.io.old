## What is Coopdevs

Coopdevs is a partnership between people who voluntarily and **without 
profit** collaborate to create technological solutions to promote and **promote 
social economy**.

Coopdevs has been officially established in February 2016 but is the result of a
path that began in 2012 and it has gathered the efforts of many people
who they have devoted their energies (both technical and creative) to different
projects that have been put in place.

We strongly believe in **free and open source software**. This is the main reason to
develop our projects using only open source software,
while seeking to contribute to the open source ecosystem.

Coopdevs projects are aimed at facilitating and promoting areas of
**social economy**  who need technological tools to solve their
specific needs, be they logistics, management and / or administrative.


## Motivations

Personal motivations that have pushed us to want to offer such
solutions are rooted in **their members' direct experience**
in the field of social economy.

From the experience matured in these contexts we detected a
recurring problems: some sectors of the social economy, especially the
voluntary sector, they are by their very nature fragmented and compounds
many small entities born spontaneously and hard
get to share experiences and support each other. Especially in relation
to organizational and management issues.

This situation means that each entity, to address their needs
daily management and administration, develops independent solutions
tailored to their specific cases and with the resources that each entity may
devote. Usually starting from scratch each time.

Often these piecemeal solutions require a great effort and
dedication and personal sacrifice of people who volunteer to
accomplishing tasks that are both exhausting and difficult phase
development and maintenance.

For this reason many of these people, tired of carrying a load of
so heavy responsibility and work, leave the projects and
inevitably they take away then knowledge required for operating
the tools and the entities themselves.

From this type of experience thus emerges the will to detect these
phenomena and focus on creating technology solutions that facilitate
management tasks for entities of the social economy ecosystem.


## Goals

The main goal of Coopdevs is **to actively contribute to
the promotion of social economy through the use of technology
information and communication**.

To achieve this goal we set specific objectives
below.


## Specific objectives

- Allow the ecosystem of the social economy to focus on their own
  objectives and devote fewer resources to create their own tools
  of work.

- Facilitate the creation of new entities by removing a potentially blocking
  element and allowing new entities inherit all
  experience and good practices of other entities contributing to
  improve management tools.

- Facilitate communication between developers and users of the various
  projects.

- Amplify the usefulness of each contribution of different entities so
  they can positively affect the entire community.

- Allow the possibility to share among all the players the production and
  maintenance costs of the different tools.


## Projects

The sectors on which Coopdevs is concentrating his work in
today are the **time banks** and **consumer groups**.

[**TimeOverflow**][1] is the software we develop and we offer as
free service for any **Time Bank** that asks for it. It facilitates the
administrative work for management teams of
Time Banks and secondly facilitates the interaction and the consequential
exchange of services between the members of a Time Bank. To improve
TimeOverflow tool has a direct impact on the social interaction
between neighbors and that motivates us to continue dedicating our efforts.

In the case of **consumer groups**, Coopdevs is working on
[**Katuma**][2], a tool that facilitates the creation and 
the management of consumer groups. A sustainable economic alternative compared to
the large distribution and to the role of market intermediaries in general.
